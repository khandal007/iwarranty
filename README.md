This Project is built on Node.js Typescript.

If the source data contains 5,000,000 rows then I'll use streams, which allows you to process the file in smaller chunks, rather than loading the entire content into memory. I'll use readline module which is used to create an interface for reading lines from the file. This approach allows you to read and process the file line by line, reducing memory usage.

If I have more time then I'll optimize the code, so that it less time to execute and provide results faster and use less memory.
